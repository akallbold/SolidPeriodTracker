Solid Period Tracker is a project, for now in an incipient phase, build with Solid.
The available Period Tracker Apps have a questionable implementtion when it comes to 'where and how the data is stored and used'. There have been reported issues on this topic over the past years[[1]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xe4yz/menstrual-app-period-tracker-data-cyber-security)[[2]](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/the-vicious-cycle-of-tracking-periods-with-apps-20190920-p52t7k.html)[[3]](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/period-tracker-app-spied-told-20807187) but with the recent RvW topic [[1]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/why-us-woman-are-deleting-their-period-tracking-apps)[[2]](https://www.dw.com/en/period-trackers-how-apps-exploit-your-menstrual-cycle/a-62289461)[[3]](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkpbq/period-tracking-apps-data-privacy-safety), it simply filled our cups and prompted the creation of this repository. We believe Solid to be the protocol and technology which should be at the base of such social themes.

# Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
